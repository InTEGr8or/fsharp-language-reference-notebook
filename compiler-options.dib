# Compiler options

 +7 

This topic describes compiler command-line options for the F# compiler, fsc.exe.

The compilation environment can also be controlled by setting the project properties. For projects targeting .NET Core, the "Other flags" property, `<OtherFlags>...</OtherFlags>` in `.fsproj`, is used for specifying extra command-line options.

## Compiler Options Listed Alphabetically

The following table shows compiler options listed alphabetically. Some of the F# compiler options are similar to the C# compiler options. If that is the case, a link to the C# compiler options topic is provided.

| Compiler Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-a filename.fs` | Generates a library from the specified file. This option is a short form of `--target:library filename.fs`. |

| `--pathmap:path=sourcePath,...` | Specifies how to map physical paths to source path names output by the compiler.  <br>  <br>This compiler option is equivalent to the C# compiler option of the same name. For more information, see [/pathmap (C# Compiler Options)](../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/advanced#pathmap). |
| `--pdb:pdb-filename` | Names the output debug PDB (program database) file. This option only applies when `--debug` is also enabled.  <br>  <br>This compiler option is equivalent to the C# compiler option of the same name. For more information, see [/pdb (C# Compiler Options)](../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/advanced#pdbfile). |

| `--staticlink:assembly-name` | Statically links the given assembly and all referenced DLLs that depend on this assembly. Use the assembly name, not the DLL name. |
| `--subsystemversion` | Specifies the version of the OS subsystem to be used by the generated executable. Use 6.02 for Windows 8.1, 6.01 for Windows 7, 6.00 for Windows Vista. This option only applies to executables, not DLLs, and need only be used if your application depends on specific security features available only on certain versions of the OS. If this option is used, and a user attempts to execute your application on a lower version of the OS, it will fail with an error message. |
| `--tailcalls[+|-]` | Enables or disables the use of the tail IL instruction, which causes the stack frame to be reused for tail recursive functions. This option is enabled by default. |
| `--target:[exe|winexe|library|module] filename` | Specifies the type and file name of the generated compiled code.<ul><li><code>exe</code> means a console application.<br></li><li><code>winexe</code> means a Windows application, which differs from the console application in that it does not have standard input/output streams (stdin, stdout, and stderr) defined.<br></li><li><code>library</code> is an assembly without an entry point.<br></li><li><code>module</code> is a .NET Framework module (.netmodule), which can later be combined with other modules into an assembly.<br></li><ul>This compiler option is equivalent to the C# compiler option of the same name.

| `--warn:warning-level` | Sets a warning level (0 to 5). The default level is 3. Each warning is given a level based on its severity. Level 5 gives more, but less severe, warnings than level 1.  <br>  <br>Level 5 warnings are: 21 (recursive use checked at runtime), 22 (`let rec` evaluated out of order), 45 (full abstraction), and 52 (defensive copy). All other warnings are level 2.  <br>  <br>This compiler option is equivalent to the C# compiler option of the same name. For more information, see [/warn (C# Compiler Options)](../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/errors-warnings#warninglevel). |
